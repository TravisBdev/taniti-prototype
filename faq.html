                <h3>Power Outlets</h3>
                <p>
                    Taniti uses 120-volt power outlets, the same as the United States, so no special adapters are needed for U.S. travelers.

                <h3>Alcohol Sales</h3>
                <p>
                    Alcohol cannot be sold or served between midnight and 9:00 a.m., so plan accordingly if youâ€™re looking to grab a late-night drink.

                <h3>Language</h3>
                <p>
                    Many younger Tanitians speak English fluently, especially in urban areas. However, in rural parts of the island, especially among older residents, English is less common.
